# LK-Airtight
LK Airtight Patch Mod
This mod is supposed to patch Vanilla and modded materials to be airtight 
I added load folders to this version to try to get rid of the red load errors on startup that appeared when supported mods werent installed.
This caused the game to go to a black screen on load and not load .
